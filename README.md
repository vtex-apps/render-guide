  # VTEX IO Web Framework Best-Practices

  ## Welcome
  While coding apps, developers face common problems and patterns that are not strictly related to their business logic, like pagination and editing entities. To help you focuss more on your business logic, and less on reinventing the wheel, this repo was created aimming to contain all common patterns, all while respecting **Web Framework's** best practices and performance.

  ## What can I learn in this code base?
  In this repo you will learn how to:

  - Use [VTEX Styleguide](https://styleguide.vtex.com/)
  - Internationalize your app
  - GraphQL (Back-End):
    - Architecture a GraphQL Schema
    - Create resolvers
    - Use Datasources
  - Front-End
    - Use extension points
    - Automatic cache updates
    - Preview with GraphQL cache
    - Pagination

  ## Can I use this repo in my projects ?
  Sure! this repository was designed with this goal in mind. If you are not able to easily port this code into your app, feel free to make a PR and start [contributing](https://github.com/vtex-apps/awesome-io#contributing).

  ## Getting Started
  This repo is an IO app like any other, so getting started is easy, just clone it, open your terminal, and type:

  \`\`\`sh
  vtex link
  \`\`\`

  just enter the \`/guide\` route and play a little

  ## How to read this repo
  An antipattern present in this repo is that the front and back-end code are in the same app. Usually they are split into different apps, given their differences in development cycle. Also, if your project is big enough, it's suggested you split your front-end app into a components app and a **Pages** app (app that places and instantiates these components). For the sake of simplicity and example efficiency, all these apps are joined into this one

  ### Basic architecture
  Since *web-framework-guide* is a VTEX IO app like any other, its folder structure is well known. In the root folder you can find a \`manifest.json\`, containing all of the app's metadata, like name, vendor, version etc. Also, you will find the following folders, each one matching it's corresponding builder

  - node - *where you actually implement your back-end app*
  - graphql - *where you define your graphql schema*
  - react - *where you write your react components*
  - pages - *where you place and instantiate the components*
